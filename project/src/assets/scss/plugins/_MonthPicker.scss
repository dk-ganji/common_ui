  /*
  The plugin uses buttons with a transparent background in the year-table
  (aka header) in order to look consistent with jQuery UI datepicker and to
  make the year title a button that blends into the heading in the default state.

  The plugin does this by removing the .ui-state-default class from (in MonthPicker.js)
  the a tags (buttons) which also ends up removing the 1px border that it applies.

  To prevent the button from resizing and moving everything around when you hover
  in and out, we use a carefully constructed selector, which gets overroden by the
  more specific .ui-state-hover/actove class selectors in the jquery-ui.css
  that apply the visible borders that we want.

  This selector applies a 1px transparent border that keeps the button
  in the same size, but it doesen't hide the borders that .ui-state-hover/actove give us.
  */

  /*
  Sets the size of the next/previous buttons,
  and makes the buttons in the heading (year-table) sligtly bigger,
  and removes the pointer cursor from the buttons in the heading (year-table).
  */

  /*
  The buttons in the heading (year-table) are slightly shrinked, but because jQuery ui and
  the .month-picker .ui-button-text rule at the top of this CSS file apply some
  padding which results in the button text being moved to the bottom of
  the button.

  This rule removes the unnecessary padding so the text in
  the jump years button will be vericaly centred.
